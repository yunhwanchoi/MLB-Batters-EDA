# EDA of MLB Batters from 1985 to 2020

I conducted basic exploratory data analysis to explore patterns and correlations within an MLB batter's performance metrics dating from 1985. I also attempted to highlight important factors that contribute to a team reaching the postseason (playoffs). I plan to use some of the insights gained from the following rudimentary data exploration for other personal projects such as using machine learning to determine whether a team is undervaluing or overvaluing a player, understanding player performance regression, as well as predicting the number of team wins given historical stats of players in the team.  

This project uses data from Sean Lahman's Baseball Database. The URL of the source of the data is http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/.
